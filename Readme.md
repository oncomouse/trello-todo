# trello-todo

This converts my custom todo list format into Trello cards for productivity tracking.

There is also a script (in `cron.js`) that, given a board name and a list of list names, will mark all tasks as done on that list. I use this to mark my Todo List items in my "Done" list as complete, each night at midnight.
